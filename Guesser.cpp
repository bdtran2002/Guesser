  Returns an whole number representing the distance between the guess,

  of characters that would have to be changed at the same location to match
  the other string. When the two strings are identical, the distance is 0,
  but for each letter different, the distance increases by 1. When the
  strings are different lengths, each of the extra characters in the longer
  string also counts as an increase in 1 to the distance, up to the length of
  the secret; in other words, if m_secret has a 10 characters and the guess
  has 100, the distance is 10.

  without any being a true match, the secret is locked. However, whenever
  an unlocked secret is guessed with a true match, the guesses remaining
  reset to three (3). If the secret is locked for any other reason, such
  as a big distance in a guess, the count of remaining guesses should still
  count down as usual to hide that the secret has been locked.
